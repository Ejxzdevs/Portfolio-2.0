each breakpoint what font size u recommend for title and paragraph
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Choosing appropriate font sizes for titles and paragraphs across various breakpoints ensures that your content remains readable and visually appealing on all devices. Here's a general recommendation for font sizes at each breakpoint, covering both titles (e.g., h1, h2, etc.) and paragraph text (p).

Recommended Font Sizes for Each Breakpoint:
1. Below 320px (Very Small Mobile)
Title (h1): 18px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 16px, 14px
Paragraph Text (p): 12px
Notes:

For screens this small, use very compact fonts to ensure readability without overcrowding the screen. Minimal padding and margins can also help conserve space.
2. 320px – 480px (Extra Small Mobile)
Title (h1): 20px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 18px, 16px
Paragraph Text (p): 14px
Notes:

This is a more typical size for older or smaller phones. Keep fonts legible but still space-efficient. Consider using a more condensed font style for titles if space becomes too tight.
3. 481px – 600px (Small Mobile – Landscape)
Title (h1): 22px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 20px, 18px
Paragraph Text (p): 15px
Notes:

Landscape orientations give more space for text. Increase title and subtitle sizes slightly while still keeping paragraph text readable.
4. 601px – 768px (Small Tablets – Portrait)
Title (h1): 26px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 24px, 20px
Paragraph Text (p): 16px
Notes:

Tablets in portrait mode provide more room, allowing for larger fonts without compromising readability. Consider increasing spacing between lines to improve readability on larger screens.
5. 1025px – 1280px (Small Desktops and Laptops)
Title (h1): 32px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 28px, 24px
Paragraph Text (p): 18px
Notes:

On laptops and small desktops, titles can be significantly larger without becoming overwhelming. Text should remain clean and comfortable to read, with generous spacing.
6. 1281px – 1440px (Large Desktops and High-Resolution Screens)
Title (h1): 40px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 36px, 30px
Paragraph Text (p): 20px
Notes:

Large desktops and high-resolution screens allow for even larger font sizes, especially for headings. Ensure titles stand out while keeping paragraph text easy to read. The goal is a spacious, easy-to-navigate layout.
7. 1441px and up (Extra-Large Screens – Ultra-Wide, Large Desktops)
Title (h1): 48px
Subtitles (h2, h3): 42px, 36px
Paragraph Text (p): 22px
Notes:

On extra-large or ultra-wide screens, you'll want the title and body text to be large enough to avoid looking too small in the context of a large, spacious layout. You may also want to consider increasing the line-height for better readability.
